# Social media (Link management)

The Social Media Link Manager is a dynamic web application designed to facilitate the easy management and display of social media links on a user interface. This project leverages JavaScript and local storage to provide an interactive experience for users to add, delete, and view social media link badges and corresponding URL input rows. It is an ideal solution for personal websites, portfolios, or any platform where showcasing and organizing social media presence is essential.

Key Features:

- **Local Storage Integration:** The application uses local storage to save the state of badges and URLs, ensuring persistence of user data across sessions.

- **Real-time UI Updates:** The interface updates in real time as users add, delete, or modify their social media links.

- **Validation and Error Handling:** The application includes URL validation to ensure that only proper links are saved, and provides user feedback for incorrect inputs.
